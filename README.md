# OpenAI-API Playground ðŸ“•

## Achievements
âœ… Built a city activity reccomender.  
âœ… Created a meal prep plan generator that takes in allergies and fitness goals.
```python
def city_activity(city):
  zero_shot_prompt = """Output a list of four reccomendations, line by line.
                      """

  # All GPT completions are generated by the chat model. The chat model works best
  # when it's given a baseline instruction about how GPT should behave.
  system_message = {"role" : "system", "content" : "Give a list of four activites to do in the given city, line by line."}

  # the response from OpenAI's API is a JSON object that contains the completion to your prompt plus some other information.  
  # Here's how to access just the text of the completion.

## Purpose:
#### This repsoitory is used as a playground to experiment with OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo API and learn about its abilities. 

## Next Goal:
#### ðŸ”œ Incorporate OpenAI Vision API in the notebook to experiment with AI image analysis.
