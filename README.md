# OpenAI-API Playground ðŸ“•

## Achievements
âœ… Built a city activity recommender.  

```python
def city_activity(city):
  zero_shot_prompt = """Output a list of four reccomendations, line by line.
                      """

  # All GPT completions are generated by the chat model. The chat model works best
  # when it's given a baseline instruction about how GPT should behave.
  system_message = {"role" : "system", "content" : "Give a list of four activites to do in the given city, line by line."}

  client = openai.OpenAI()
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages= [
          system_message,
          {"role" : "user", "content" : zero_shot_prompt + city + " - "} # simulate a user prompt
      ],
      temperature=0.7,
      max_tokens=256,
      top_p=1,
      frequency_penalty=0,
      presence_penalty=0,
      stop=["---"]
  )
  
  time.sleep(1)

  # the response from OpenAI's API is a JSON object that contains the completion to your prompt plus some other information.  
  # Here's how to access just the text of the completion.
  list = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
  return list


city = """
Denver
"""

answer = city_activity(city)
print(answer)
```
### Output
```
1. Visit the Red Rocks Amphitheatre for a concert or hike among the stunning rock formations.
2. Explore the Denver Art Museum to see a diverse collection of art from around the world.
3. Take a stroll through the historic Larimer Square for shopping, dining, and vibrant nightlife.
4. Head to Denver Botanic Gardens to admire beautiful plant displays and peaceful gardens.
```
âœ… Created a meal prep plan generator that takes in allergies and fitness goals.  
``` python
def meal_plan(allergies, fitness_goal):
  # TODO - write this function
  zero_shot_prompt = """Given the dietary restrictions and fitness goals, output a list of what to eat during the week.
                      """

  # All GPT completions are generated by the chat model now. The chat model works best
  # when it's given a baseline instruction about how GPT should behave. We'll use this one.
  system_message = {"role" : "system", "content" : "Output a list of what to eat in the week based on the dietary restrictions and fitness goals."}

  client = openai.OpenAI()
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages= [
          system_message,
          {"role" : "user", "content" : zero_shot_prompt + allergies + fitness_goal + " - "} # simulate a user prompt
      ],
      temperature=0.7,
      max_tokens=256,
      top_p=1,
      frequency_penalty=0,
      presence_penalty=0,
      stop=["---"]
  )
  
  time.sleep(1)

  # the response from OpenAI's API is a JSON object that contains
  # the completion to your prompt plus some other information.  Here's how to access
  # just the text of the completion.
  summary = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
  return summary

allergies = """
Peanuts, strawberries, gluten.
"""
fitness_goals = """
I would like to gain 20 pounds of muscle in the next year. 
"""


answer = meal_plan(allergies, fitness_goals)

## Purpose:
#### This repsoitory is used as a playground to experiment with OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo API and learn about its abilities. 

## Next Goal:
#### ðŸ”œ Incorporate OpenAI Vision API in the notebook to experiment with AI image analysis.
